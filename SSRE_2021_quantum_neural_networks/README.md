# SSRE-Abstract-QuantumNeuralNetworks
This repository holds the Abstract created in support of quantum neural network analogs. The Abstract:

1. Introduces the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and its inefficiency with Gradient Descent
2. Given that the solution for a FFNN is [NP-complete](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1988/file/3def184ad8f4755ff269862ea77393dd-Paper.pdf), we explore previous attempts at neural network analogs and discuss advantages and disadvantages of each method. 
3. At the end, we propose to implement a Quantum Neural Network via the [Quantum Approximate Optimization Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028).
