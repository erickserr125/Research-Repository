# Solutions-Manual-Unofficial---A-First-Introduction-to-Quantum-Computing-and-Information
In collaboration with the author of this book, Dr. Bernard Zygelman, I have begun creating a solutions manual for every chapter of "A First Introduction to Quantum Computing and Information."


## Objective: 

The objective of this repository is to contain the unofficial solutions for every chapter of our quantum computing book. Currently, 5 chapters have been completed (and will be modified upon review and notification of incorrectness).

## Next Steps

The next steps are to generate solutions for chapter 6 of the book. This is expected to be completed in ~1 week.
